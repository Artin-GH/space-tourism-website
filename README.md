## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) - Programming language
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [React Transition Group](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-transition-group) - React library
- [PostCSS](https://postcss.org) - JS tool
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) - CSS framework


### What I learned

I learned [React Transition Group](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-transition-group) library, used [Postcss Functions](https://github.com/andyjansson/postcss-functions) plugin for the first time and learned something about [CSS Color Converter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/css-color-converter), [PostCSS](https://postcss.org), [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) tools.

### Continued development

I love this concept. So I'm going to make a `Star Wars` version of this website as my future project. I think and hope that this project will be very useful for learning and experiencing new things.


### Useful resources

- [CSS box-shadow maker](https://www.example.com) - This is page that allows you to make css `box-shadow`s much quicker.
- [Detect window size](https://stackoverflow.com/a/63408216) - This solution helped me to finally learn detecting window size in `Next.js` and `React`.
